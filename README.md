Introduction
----------------------------------------

Welcome! Helium aspires to be a fully-featured open source game engine.

This project was seeded with code from [Nocturnal Initiative][], an open source
project at [Insomniac Games][]. Further development was generously funded for a
time by [WhiteMoon Dreams][].

Prerequisites
----------------------------------------

 - Visual Studio 2010. (Visual Studio 2008 SP1 may work, but is not supported;
   service pack 1 is required for regular expression and compiler fixes.)
 - DirectX SDK (installed to default location)
 - Python 3
 - [FBX 2012.2 SDK](http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/pc/item?siteID=123112&id=20425230)

Note that the build process creates NTFS hard links to libraries, which can fail
if the source and destination are on different volumes. If you have problems,
try copying the contents of the FBX SDK to `[Helium root]/Integrations/FBX` and
setting the `FBX_SDK` environment variable to point there.


Building Helium
----------------------------------------

First, generate the project files using premake. A premake4 binary is included
for Windows. Project files generated by premake will be placed in the
`[Helium root]/Premake` directory. Currently, the most common target is Visual
Studio 2010, in which case you would launch the VS2010 command prompt, then
navigate to the Helium directory and run `premake vs2010`. You can find more
details and other platforms at http://industriousone.com/premake-quick-start.

Once the project files have been generated, open Dependencies.sln. This solution
needs to be built in all configuration and platform combinations that you intend
to build Helium in. You may find it convenient to "Batch Build" all combinations
now so that you don't need to worry about it later.

After you've built Dependencies.sln, you should be able to build Helium. You
will most likely want to build Tools.sln, which includes the editor, whereas
Runtime.sln builds only "shipping" code (no asset pipeline or other tools).
If you opted not to batch build all Dependencies.sln permutations in the last
step, then ensure that your configuration and platform choices are consistent
with the ones you made there.


Platform Agnosticism
----------------------------------------

We are moving toward a platform-agnostic toolkit (previously Windows-only).
For the time being we are moving all platform-specific API calls into
Platform.vcproj.

============

Introduction
----------------------------------------

Welcome! Helium aspires to be a fully-featured open source game engine.

This project was seeded with code from [Nocturnal Initiative][], an open source
project at [Insomniac Games][]. Further development was generously funded for a
time by [WhiteMoon Dreams][].

Prerequisites
----------------------------------------

All
 - [FBX SDK 2014.1](http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/pc/item?siteID=123112&id=10775847)

Windows
 - Visual Studio 2010 or 2012. (Visual Studio 2008 SP1 may work, but is not supported;
   service pack 1 is required for regular expression and compiler fixes.)
 - DirectX SDK (installed to default location)

OSX
 - XCode 4
 - XCode Command Line Tools (install from within XCode preferences)

Linux
 - sudo apt-get install build-essential libgtk2.0-dev libglapi-mesa libbullet-dev libfreetype6-dev libpng12-dev libnvtt2-dev libois-dev libz-dev

Building Helium
----------------------------------------

First, grab our source tree from git. Ensure that you run 
"git submodule update --init --recursive".

Next, generate the project files using premake. A premake4 binary is included
for Windows. Project files generated by premake will be placed in the
`/Premake` directory relative to cwd.

Example for Visual Studio 2010:

cd Dependencies
../premake vs2010

cd ..
premake vs2010

The first call to premake builds the Dependencies solution, and the second builds
the main solution.  Substitute vs2010 for vs2012, or gmake on linux, or xcode4
on macosx.

Once the project files have been generated, open Dependencies.sln.  It will be in 
Dependencies/Premake/. This solution needs to be built in all configuration and
platform combinations that you intend to build Helium in. If you are using Visual
Studio, you may find it convenient to "Batch Build" all combinations now so that
you don't need to worry about it later.

After you've built Dependencies.sln, you should be able to build Helium. You
will most likely want to build Tools.sln, which includes the editor, whereas
Runtime.sln builds only "shipping" code (no asset pipeline or other tools).
If you opted not to batch build all Dependencies.sln permutations in the last
step, then ensure that your configuration and platform choices are consistent
with the ones you made there.

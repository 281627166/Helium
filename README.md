Helium aspires to be a fully-featured open-source game engine:
* Permissively licensed (BSD-style)
* Designed to scale to large-scale game development
* Portable to different architectures, including game consoles, smartphones, and tablets
* Use familiar industry-standard DCC user interface and usability design
* Import content using production proven interchange formats (like FBX)

# Building #

Helium is built using [premake](http://industriousone.com/premake).  Premake interprets lua script and generates platform-specific IDE project files.  Currently Helium modules are built into three categories: Core, Tools, and Runtime.  This is done due to allow the HELIUM\_TOOLS macro to conditionally compile tools-only code at any level of the codebase (except for Core modules, which are agnostic to HELIUM\_TOOLS).
* The Tools modules aim to yield a monolithic, integrated editor for the creation of game content, as well as any command line utilities necessary to streamline production.
* The Runtime modules aim to be an asset pipeline-free build of the game engine fit for bundling on a console disk, or distributed via app store.

Prerequisites:

All Platforms
 - [FBX SDK 2014.2](http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/pc/item?siteID=123112&id=10775847)

Windows
 - Visual Studio 2010 or 2012. (Visual Studio 2008 SP1 will probably work, but is not actively supported; service pack 1 is required for regular expression and compiler fixes.)
 - DirectX SDK (installed to default location)

OSX
 - Recent XCode Command Line Tools (install from within XCode preferences)

Linux
 - sudo Dependencies/install-packages.sh

First, grab our source tree from git. Ensure that you run "git submodule update --init --recursive".

Next, generate the project files using premake. A premake4 binary is included for Windows. Project files generated by premake will be placed in the `/Premake` directory relative to cwd.

Example for Visual Studio 201x:

    cd Dependencies
    ../premake vs201x
    start Dependencies.sln
    
    cd ..
    premake vs201x
    start Helium.sln

On mac or linux, use premake to generate makefiles (Xcode support inside premake is on hold as of late):

    cd Dependencies
    ../premake.sh gmake
    make -j8
    
    cd ..
    ./premake.sh gmake
    make -j8
    
On mac you may get a dependency check error about your FBX SDK containing spaces, to work around it just make a symlink without spaces and set the FBK_SDK environment variable.  See mklink and export (amending your .bash_profile file) for help setting those up.

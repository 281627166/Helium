Helium
======

Welcome!  Helium aims to be an open source game engine toolkit to
help provide foundation technology and GUI tools for building game
engines (not games per se).

This project was seeded with code from Nocturnal Initiative, an open
source project at Insomniac Games.  Further development was generously
funded for a time by Whitemoon Dreams, Inc. Currently, no commercial
sponsorship exists, but development is continuing by private individuals.

Prerequisites
=============

Visual Studio 2010
 - Visual Studio 2008 + SP1 may work but is untested (SP1 is required for 
   regex and compiler fixes)
DirectX SDK (installed to default location)
Python 3
FBX SDK (http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/index?siteID=123112&id=7478532)
 - Download the DLL version and install it. If you have trouble with our build system
   making a hard link to the resources, try copying the contents to
   [helium root]/Integrations/FBX and update the FBX_SDK environment variable to
   point here.

Building Helium
===============

First, generate project files by using premake4. premake4 is included
prebuilt for win32 platforms. Project files generated by premake will be 
placed in the [helium root]/Premake folder. Currently the most common
target is Visual Studio 2010. For that target, run the VS2010 command line,
then navigate to the root of helium and run "premake vs2010". You'll find 
details for other platforms at http://industriousone.com/premake-quick-start.
The process is very similar for other platforms.

Next, you'll need to build Dependencies.sln, which should build all
the libraries Helium depends upon.  You must build Dependencies.sln
using the same Project Configuration and Platform as you plan to use
for Helium.  (Eg: Debug / Win32, Release Unicode / x64)

Once you've built Dependencies.sln, you should be able to build
Helium. Most likely you'll want to build Tools.sln. It includes
everything, whereas Runtime.sln only builds "shipping" code.. i.e.
no asset pipeline or other tools. Again, make sure your Project 
Configuration and Platform is consistent with what you built for
Dependencies.sln.

====================
Platform Agnosticism
====================

We are moving toward a platform-agnostic toolkit from windows-only.  For
the time being we are moving all platform-specific API calls into
Platform.vcproj.

================
Third-party SDKs
================

For boost and wxWidgets you will need to download and build it manually.
Download both source zips and place them into your tree like this:
 
  SDK\boost\1.43\<boost files>
  SDK\wxWidgets\2.8.11\<wxWidgets files>

then, to build the appropriate configs run (from the project root dir):

  build_boost.pl -v 1.43
  build_wxWidgets.pl -v 2.8.11
  
using the correct version numbers (the versions you downloaded)

=======
Unicode
=======

Unicode is built via solution and project configurations (Debug Unicode
and Release Unicode).  wxWidgets is signalled to compile and link via
wxUSE_UNICODE which is specified in the Unicode.vsprops file.  This
vsprops file is inherited only in Unicode project configurations.

====
DLLs
====

Most projects are configured to be built as static libs, but its a best
practice to continue to use *_API macros to dllexport/dllimport symbols.

Depending on how plugin support comes online we may have to put these
macros back into play to build the DLLs we need to properly support code
sharing in plugins and host applications.

====================
Platform Agnosticism
====================

We are moving toward a platform-agnostic toolkit from windows-only.  For
the time being we are moving all platform-specific API calls into
Platform.vcproj.

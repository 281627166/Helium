======
Helium
======

Welcome!  Helium aims to be an open source game engine toolkit to
help provide foundation technology and GUI tools for building game
engines (not games per se).

This project was seeded with code from Nocturnal Initiative, an open
source project at Insomniac Games.

=============
Prerequisites
=============

git
Visual Studio 2008 with SP1
DirectX SDK

===============
Building Helium
===============

First, you'll need to build Dependencies.sln, which should build all
the libraries Helium depends upon.  You must build Dependencies.sln
using the same Project Configuration and Platform as you plan to use
for Helium.  (Eg: Debug / Win32, Release Unicode / x64)


Once you've build Dependencies.sln, you should be able to build
Helium.sln.  Again, make sure your Project Configuration and Platform
setting match up.

  ===============
  Unicode Support
  ===============

  Unicode is built via solution and project configurations (Debug Unicode
  and Release Unicode).  wxWidgets is signalled to compile and link via
  wxUSE_UNICODE which is specified in the Unicode.vsprops file.  This
  vsprops file is inherited only in Unicode project configurations.

  ====
  DLLs
  ====

  Most projects are configured to be built as static libs, but its a best
  practice to continue to use *_API macros to dllexport/dllimport symbols.

  Depending on how plugin support comes online we may have to put these
  macros back into play to build the DLLs we need to properly support code
  sharing in plugins and host applications.

====================
Platform Agnosticism
====================

We are moving toward a platform-agnostic toolkit from windows-only.  For
the time being we are moving all platform-specific API calls into
Platform.vcproj.

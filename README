============
AppFramework
============

Welcome!  AppFramework aims to be an open source game engine toolkit to
help provide foundation technology and GUI tools for building game
engines (not games per se).

This project was seeded by an open source project at Insomniac Games.

================
Third-party SDKs
================

For boost and wxWidgets you will need to download and build it manually.
Wherever you put the source to them, make sure to set the 'boost' and
'wxWidgets' environment variables for our projects to locate them with.

At the current point in time, you might need to pull from wxWidget's svn
trunk to build the code without errors.

There are some convenience scripts to build the dependent SDKs:
  build_boost.pl <optional: the path to a specific version>
  build_wxWidgets.pl <optional: the path to a specific version>

=======
Unicode
=======

Unicode is built via solution and project configurations (Debug Unicode
and Release Unicode).  wxWidgets is signalled to compile and link via
wxUSE_UNICODE which is specified in the Unicode.vsprops file.  This
vsprops file is inherited only in Unicode project configurations.

====
DLLs
====

Most projects are configured to be built as static libs, but its a best
practice to continue to use *_API macros to dllexport/dllimport symbols.

Depending on how plugin support comes online we may have to put these
macros back into play to build the DLLs we need to properly support code
sharing in plugins and host applications.

====================
Platform Agnosticism
====================

We are moving toward a platform-agnostic toolkit from windows-only.  For
the time being we are moving all platform-specific API calls into
Platform.vcproj.
